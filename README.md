## ⚙️ How It Works (Simplified Workflow)

1️⃣ User gives voice/text input (e.g., “Add 2 Sugar packets”)  
2️⃣ AI converts input into structured billing actions using NLP  
3️⃣ Items are added to bill with price, quantity, and totals calculated  
4️⃣ Invoice is generated with print/download options  
5️⃣ Inventory and analytics update automatically  

📌 Workflow Diagram available in documentation — See page 9 ("EMS System Workflow").
